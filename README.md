## üìä Overview of the Data

The dataset was originally downloaded as a CSV file from [data.gov](https://data.gov), containing a single table with a unique identifier column `DIrec_No` for each crime entry. It was first imported into a **local MySQL server**, where appropriate data types were assigned to each column before further processing.

### ‚úÖ Key Data Transformations (Power Query Editor)
The following transformations were applied:
- *(To be listed based on actual steps taken ‚Äî e.g.,)*
- Removed duplicate records
- Filtered out null and blank rows
- Standardized column names and formats
- Replaced or corrected inconsistent values
- Extracted time-based features (year, month)
- Joined with external tables for enriched analysis

### üìÇ Original Columns in the LA Crime Table
At the time of import into SQL, the dataset included the following columns:
- *(List to be completed ‚Äî e.g.,)*
- DIrec_No
- Crime Date
- Reporting Area
- Weapon Used
- Premise Description
- Victim Demographics
- Crime Code Description
- Status

> üìé **Note:** Due to the size of the main table, its CSV file was not uploaded. You can [download it here](#). However, scripts and sample CSVs generated from Power Query transformations are available in this repository.

## üìä Overview
![Alt text](main/1st.png)


A total of over one million crimes‚Äîprecisely 1,005,198‚Äîwere recorded across the 21 areas of Los Angeles. Among these areas, Central stood out with the highest number of incidents, highlighting it as a focal point of concern. The average age of victims across all reported crimes was 29 years, showing that young adults continue to be the most vulnerable group.

Crimes occurred most frequently during the night period across all 21 locations, suggesting that this time frame remains the most unsafe for residents. Although the city has experienced a decline in crime rates from mid-2023 to 2025, the year-on-year (YoY) change still sits at 8.09%, which shows that the scale of incidents remains significant despite recent progress.

In terms of specific areas, the Central station recorded the highest volume of crime reports at around 70,000, followed by the 77th Street station with approximately 62,000 reports. Other stations that featured prominently in the top five include Pacific with 60,000 reports, Southwest with 58,000, and Hollywood with around 52,000 reports.

## üßç Victim Demographics

Looking into victim demographics by gender, out of the total number of reported crimes, 40.18% involved male victims, while 35.67% were female. A significant 24.14% of the cases had no gender identified for the victim, which could point to reporting limitations or cases where data wasn't fully captured.

When analyzed by age, victims between the age of 20 to 39 experienced the highest number of crimes, with 375,000 cases recorded. In contrast, victims aged 80 and above were the least affected, with only about 8,000 cases. Other age categories also recorded substantial numbers: victims aged 19 and below accounted for 311,000 cases, those between 40 to 59 years old were involved in 228,000 incidents, and the 60 to 79 age group experienced 83,000 crimes. The data paints a clear picture that the younger and working-age population is at the center of most victimizations.

On the subject of victim descent, individuals identified as Hispanic or Latino had the highest crime report figures, totaling 296,437. Reports involving victims of unknown descent followed closely at 251,495. White victims accounted for 201,451 cases, while Black victims were involved in 135,823. Other descent categories showed lower figures: 78,010 for other specified groups, 21,340 for those of other Asian descent, 5,991 for Korean descent, 4,838 for Filipino, 4,631 for Chinese, and 1,586 for Japanese. These figures reflect a mix of reporting accuracy and the city‚Äôs diverse population landscape.

## üïµÔ∏è Crime Breakdown

Analyzing the trend of crime reports by year, there was a steady rise in incidents from 2020 up until the middle of 2022. However, from that point on, a noticeable decline has been observed, continuing through to 2025. This suggests that certain enforcement or community strategies may have started to take effect post-2022.

In terms of when crimes occur, most incidents happened during the night and afternoon periods, with 255,000 and 251,000 cases respectively. Evening and morning periods also recorded high, but slightly lower, numbers at 215,000 and 212,000 respectively. This trend highlights the need for heightened vigilance during key active hours, especially after dark and in the later part of the day.

Seasonal patterns also appear to influence crime activity. January emerged as the month with the highest crime reports, whereas December saw the lowest. This variation may reflect social behavior shifts tied to seasonal events, holidays, or other environmental factors.

## üìç Crime Snapshots

When it comes to locations, the top five crime hotspots were found to be streets, single-family dwellings, multi-unit dwellings, parking lots, and other types of businesses‚Äîlisted in descending order. This indicates that both public and residential spaces are especially prone to crime, pointing toward potential improvements in neighborhood security and public surveillance.

For police stations, the top five locations for crime reports remained consistent with earlier data, with Central, 77th Street, Pacific, Southwest, and Hollywood taking the lead. These stations are evidently the busiest in terms of criminal activity and may require additional resources or support to keep up with the volume of cases.

As for crime types, the most frequently reported offenses were vehicle theft, simple battery (assault), burglary from a vehicle, identity theft, and vandalism. These reflect a mix of property crimes and personal safety concerns, particularly related to mobility and public behavior.

The top five weapons used in these crimes were listed as unknown (suggesting either lack of witness clarity or reporting gaps), strong arm (use of physical force), another form of unknown weapon, verbal threat, and handguns. The dominance of ‚Äúunknown‚Äù in weapon type also emphasizes data limitations or possibly the chaotic nature of many incidents.

## üìÑ Crime Resolutions

Regarding how quickly crimes were reported, a large majority‚Äîabout 70% of the 1,005,041 total crimes‚Äîwere reported within 24 hours of occurring. However, some cases took longer to be reported: approximately 168,000 were reported between 2 to 7 days later, 40,000 were reported after 8 to 14 days, and 33,000 were reported between 15 to 30 days. Additionally, 32,000 incidents were reported within one to three months, and another 27,000 were only reported after three months had passed. These delays could reflect the nature of the crime, trauma, or accessibility of reporting mechanisms.

In terms of resolution status, about 80% of all reported cases are still under investigation, showing the scale of ongoing law enforcement effort. Beyond that, 109,225 cases fall under a category labeled ‚Äúadult other,‚Äù and 86,877 cases have led to adult arrests. Juvenile arrests stood at 3,249, while 1,864 crimes were tagged as ‚Äújuvenile other.‚Äù Lastly, 7% of all reported crimes currently have an unknown status, pointing to cases that may be either stalled or lacking sufficient evidence.
